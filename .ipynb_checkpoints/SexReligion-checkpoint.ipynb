    "# Sex and Religion \n",
    "\n",
    "In the past, sex has been institutionalized within marriage and was broadly condemned by society.  However, over the last three decades, due to the secularization of society and sexual and contraceptive revolutions, the British public has mostly separated sexual intercourse and procreation.  Sexuality has become a more common medium of intimacy outside of marriage.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Religion, if important to an individual, can be a dominant influence on sexual behavior. For example, Christianity condemns promiscuity (casual sex) and teaches that sex should exclusively take place within marriage, as the purpose is to procreate. Many fundamentalist religious beliefs maintain that sex should serve gods will; the purpose of deepening love between a married couple and procreation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, since religious identity has fallen in recent decades (52% of Brits didn’t identify with a religion (First BSA)), views on sex, same-sex relationships, and traditional marriage have become increasingly liberal. Along with the advents of dating apps such as Tindr, the normalization of hook-up culture, attitudes towards and the stigmatization of casual sex is changing.  This shift may suggest our data follows the trend that the more important a person holds their religious beliefs the less likely they are to believe that sex without love is okay.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Although most religion remain constant on their stances on sexual behaviors, generational shifts within attitudes towards sex and casual sex leave scope for discovering how much influence religious beliefs still have on individuals attitudes towards sex without love.  "

These findings align with existing arguments from scholars, for example, Stevens argues that religion contributes to sexually conservative attitudes and therefore the more religious people are the less likely they are to think sex without love is okay.   Religious texts such as the Bible condemn sex before marriage, and religious institution typically adhere to these texts as they value historical wisdom and the status quo. \n",
